## Introduction
To extract the gait parameters without the aid of heel-strike and toe-off timing information provided by the insole sensor, it is necessary to preprocess the raw ankle tracking data generated by the Kinect SDK, i.e. to group data points into footstep clusters. Before, we had an unsuccessful attempt to use the ankle speed signal (calculated by differentiating the position signal and smoothing it using a moving average filter) to do footstep clustering, mainly because of the high noise in the Kinect data. It turns out that relying directly on the position signal is a better solution.

## Description
This function takes three n-by-1 vectors, `x`, `y`, and `t` as inputs, representing the sequence of timestamped Kinect measurement of either ankle joint positions. Two m-by-1 vectors `i_start` and `i_end` returned from the function contain the start and end indices of the footstep clusters. Below are the **steps** for finding the footstep clusters:

1. A sequence of footstep cluster candidates (candidate intervals [`i_start_cand(k)`, `i_end_cand(k)`]) is initialized to include every possible intervals containing 5 consecutive data points.
2. For each candidate interval [`i_start_cand(k)`, `i_end_cand(k)`], we grow the interval by incrementing the index of its right endpoint until:
    1. the number of outliers `num_outliers` in this interval exceeds 3 (A point in an interval is said to be an outlier if its distance to the left endpoint exceeds `dist_threshold`);
    2. the number of points in the interval reaches 30; or
    3. the right endpoint of this interval reaches the last point in the input sequence.
3. For each candidate interval [`i_start_cand(k)`, `i_end_cand(k)`], we assign its length to `sep_cand(k)`. Then we use `findpeaks` function on the vector `sep_cand`, with `MinPeakHeight = min_num_points` and `MinPeakDistance = min_peak_sep`.
